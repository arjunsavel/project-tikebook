# Project TIKEBook

## What is TIKE? What is Project TIKEBook?
The Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine, or [TIKE](https://timeseries.science.stsci.edu) is a free, cloud-based compute environment provided by STScI. It enables fast access to data in the [MAST Cloud Archive](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/stsci/): at the moment, TESS, Hubble, Kepler/K2, and GALEX Observations are available. The principle advantage using TIKE is that no downloads are necessary; you can examine terabytes of data without needing to expand your hard drive. Additionally, we pre-install common astronomy packages, which makes TIKE an ideal teaching tool.

Project TIKEBook is an open-source textbook, designed to teach people how to "do astronomy" on the cloud. This set of lessons 

## Getting Started
These lessons are pre-loaded into [TIKE](https://timeseries.science.stsci.edu) and are designed to work in our cloud environment. If you're not already reading this on the TIKE platform, you should switch to that now.

## Development and Use 

### Open-Source Classroom Use
Project TIKEBook is open-source, and we encourage teachers (at any level) to use TIKE for lessons.

### I'd like to contribute!
Please do! We especially value feedback from people using the "TIKEBook" in a classroom setting, but everyone is welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request.
